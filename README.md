Basic raytracer I made for 42.

You will need to install minilibx to compile this.

This raytracer is still WIP.
I'll probably add more information in the overlay. (camera position / rendering time / etc)

Made with the help of various tutorials on the web.

// Print some other primitives instead of spheres
// A parser
