Basic raytracer for 42.
Still WIP.

Some weird bugs are still around, especially with the camera.
I'll probably add more information in the overlay too. (camera position / rendering time / etc)

Made with the help of various tutorials on the web.

TODOLIST :
// Light, material and color effect
// Print some other primitives instead of spheres
// A parser
// A background (maybe a skybox ?)
// Fix those damned bugs
